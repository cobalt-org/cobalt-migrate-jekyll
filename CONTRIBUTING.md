If you're looking for things to do check out the [open issues](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-migrate-jekyll/issues), especially those with the [easy](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-migrate-jekyll/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) flag. Or take a grep through [all TODO comments](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt-migrate-jekyll/search?q=TODO) in the code and feel free to help us out there!

ðŸŒˆ **Here's a checklist for the perfect pull request:**
- [ ] Make sure existing tests still work by running `cargo test` locally.
- [ ] Add new tests for any new feature or regression tests for bugfixes.
- [ ] Install [Clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) and run `rustup run nightly cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes (will be checked by Travis)
- [ ] Install [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) and run `cargo fmt` to format your code (will also be checked by Travis)

# Releasing

When we're ready to release, a project owner should do the following
- Determine what the next version is, according to semver
- Bump version in a commit
  - Run `clog --setversion <X>.<Y>.<Z>`, touch up the log
  - Update the version in `Cargo.toml`
  - Run `cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock`
- Tag the commit via `git tag -a v<X>.<Y>.<Z>`
- `git push upstream master --tag v<X>.<Y>.<Z>`
- Run `cargo publish` (run `cargo login` first if needed)
